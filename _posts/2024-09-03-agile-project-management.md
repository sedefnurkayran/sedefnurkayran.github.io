<p> What is Agile?

Agile, as the name suggests, is an approach based on being agile, reacting quickly and adapting to change. Agile principles are rooted in the principles of Lean manufacturing, first introduced by Toyota in the 1950s, and these principles are especially important in software development processes.

The Difference between Traditional Project Management and Agile Project Management

In traditional project management, feasibility studies and timelines set at the beginning make it costly to make changes later in the process. Agile methodology offers a solution to this problem; it breaks the project into small pieces, allowing decisions to be made based on new information at the end of each cycle. This flexibility makes it possible to respond quickly to customer needs and market changes, and to make changes at low cost. This results in a higher quality product and increased customer satisfaction.

Agile Project Management and Sprints

In Agile methodology, which prioritizes flexibility and adaptability to manage projects more efficiently, projects are managed by dividing them into small parts. The goal is to create value in sprints that usually last 1-4 weeks. At the end of each sprint, it is ensured that the product is suitable for the customer's use and that their needs are met. In subsequent cycles, the product is continuously developed in an incremental manner based on customer feedback, focusing on adding value to the product with each iteration.

Agile Manifesto and Values

The Agile Manifesto is published with four core values. These values guide teams to improve customer satisfaction. These values are; 
1. Individuals and Interactions
2. Running Software
3. Customer collaboration
4. Responding to Change

Agile Methodologies

Scrum and Kanban stand out among the main methodologies under the Agile roof. Scrum aims for teams to plan in short cycles (sprints) and deliver a working product at the end of these cycles. On the other hand, Kanban is based on continuous flow and visualization of the project on board.

What is SCRUM?

SCRUM is a simple and common methodology to implement. Kan Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland standardized this method by publishing the SCRUM guide in 2010. In SCRUM, teams are self-planning; instead of a management-oriented structure, individuals are at the forefront. Each team plans its own sprint and can substitute each other by working cross-functionally. In this way, the flexibility and adaptability of teams increases and projects progress more efficiently.

What are Epic and Backlog?

In SCRUM processes, Epics, which are large pieces of work, are divided into parts, each to be completed in a single sprint. The backlog, which is known as the to-do list, is used like a master notebook. Each job in the backlog is called a PBI (Product Backlog Item). For example, let's consider a list of 10 jobs. In the first sprint, 5 of these jobs are selected and a Sprint Backlog is created and these jobs are completed throughout the sprint. This structure allows projects to progress more efficiently.

Roles in SCRUM

In SCRUM, roles and rituals form the core elements of project management.

1. Product Owner: Owns the product backlog and sequences it to create value, as well as organizes the sprints.
2. Scrum Master: Knows the SCRUM guidelines and ensures that the team works within this framework; responsible for the functioning of the structure.
3. Developer (Team Members): Consists of the people who develop the product.

SCRUM Rituals

SCRUM has regular rituals:

1. Daily: 15-minute meetings are held every day to discuss the obstacles encountered.
2. Sprint Planning: The work to be done is determined and the sprint begins.
3. Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the work done is reviewed and evaluated with stakeholders.
4. Retrospective: In retrospective meetings, usually held on the same day as the Sprint Review, process improvement items are discussed, interpersonal interactions are evaluated and feedback is exchanged.

Contributions of Agile in Business

Agile has revolutionized the business world. This approach increases the flexibility of teams, prioritizes customer satisfaction and accelerates product development processes. Quickly adapting to changes in projects and continuously creating value is one of Agile's greatest strengths. This structure of Agile is one of its main features that minimizes risk in projects while increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
