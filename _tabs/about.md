I'm Sedefnur Kayran. I graduated from the Yalova University <https://www.yalova.edu.tr/>, with a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering.

I've published a article describes Digital Twin creation and use in scheduling for mass manufacturing enterprises <https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/jeps/issue/70655/1068970>.

I share the notes I have taken from the trainings I have attended with you in this blog. My aim is to summarize what I have learned and keep notes for myself. Also, I hope my posts will be useful for you too.
